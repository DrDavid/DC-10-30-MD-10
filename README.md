Project Description:

This project continues the development of the Boeing/McDonnell-Douglas DC-10-30 and its variants for FlightGear Flight Simulator.

I am in the process of upgrading the instrumentation of the flightdeck as well as improve the overall realism of the model (such as providing bulkheads for the passenger doors and cargo hatches, among many others).

I am also generally following the historical upgrades that Boeing/McDonnell-Douglas made to create the MD-10. From Wikipedia:

MD-10 upgrade

	The MD-10 is retrofit cockpit upgrade to the DC-10 and a re-designation to MD-10. The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) used on the MD-11 and was launched in 1996. The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD-11. This allows companies such as FedEx Express, which operate both the MD-10 and MD-11, to have a common pilot pool for both aircraft. The MD-10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter program where Boeing's international affiliate companies perform the conversions.

Therefore,  the MD-10 is included in the name of the overall project.

Ryan Miller, the DC-10-30's creator and developer, gave the aircraft a significant workover for the release FG 2.12.0, with excellent results! The changes I include in this version are envisioned out of those fixes and improvements.

As importantly, the DC-10-30 is equipped with the new Canvas-ready Navdisplay for the MFD, a major step forward in FlightGear's simulation sophistication and realism.

Initially, I planned the project to find "off-the-shelf" instruments that could be fitted into the DC-10's flightdeck arrangement, not only by physically placing them in a format that would take into account panel design such as "the sacred six" but would work with the model's YAsim format.  Miller's CRJ700 provided the PFD and EICAS, along with other components such as rhe CDU, radios, side panels and upper panel.

To my great satisfaction, I was, for the most part correct. Except for the parts where a three-engined jetliner and a two-engined one...you get the point. There is a lot of work to do convert the CRJ-700 avionics to the DC-10-30's.  And even more work to integrate the Canvas-powered navigation display.  The components for the ND came from the new Mirage 2000 by 5H1N0B1.  

Having said this, the changes I am making to the DC-10-30 are "cosmetic" though they are mostly functional and have a pretty good look to them. I have a TODO List needing to be implemented to "complete" this refit to the MD-10, with an eye toward making the DC-10-30-MD-10 among the very best aircraft in the FlightGear Hanger. That will be Phase 2, 3, etc.

Thanks to Phil Efstahiou for the great "Orbis Flying Eye Hospital" livery!
